# Independence test

"Independence test" is a project made by two data engineering students in which they use a random sample of 1,000 registered voters according to their economic position and whether they are "for" or "against" the tax reform in the state of Illinois, USA.

The goal is to determine if voter opinions are independent of their income levels using hypothesis testing and the chi-square test procedure. It is commonly required knowledge about Probability, Statistic, and Python language to understand what the project is about.
