# Statistical Grade

"Statistical Grade" is a project made by two data engineering students in which they use their group's grades to compare the development during the quarter and through analysis get some answer about specific factors that affect as both advantages and disadvantages in the student's scores 

It contains information recollected through 4 months by our programming class teacher. It is commonly required a little bit knowledge about Probability, Statistic, and Python language to understand what the project is about


## Usage

```python
import StatisticalGrade

StatisticalGrade.average('word') # returns 'the average'
StatisticalGrade.percentile('goose') # returns 'the specific percentile'
```
